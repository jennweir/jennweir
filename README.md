### Hi there, I'm Jennifer :raising_hand_woman: 
I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science with a minor in Complex Systems at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor :part_alternation_mark: Go Blue! Last summer I interned at Northrop Grumman as a Systems Test Engineer. I'm a passionate student :books: with an intrinsic desire to learn more about new scientific breakthroughs and current events in :computer: tech. I love learning new things and I'm always open to working on interesting projects with new people! 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a mobile application with [Void Tech](https://github.com/void-tech-um) where I am a developer lead on a team with 8 student devs.
