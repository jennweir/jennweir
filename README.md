### Hi there, I'm Jennifer! :raising_hand_woman: 
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/Hers

I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science with a minor in Complex Systems at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor (graduating April 2024) :part_alternation_mark: Go Blue! I have interned with Ford Motor Company :blue_car: as a Software Engineer Intern (Summer 2023) and at Northrop Grumman as a Systems Test Engineer where I worked as a NASA contractor at the Armstrong Flight Research Center :rocket: (Summer 2022). I'm a passionate student :books: with an intrinsic desire to learn more about new scientific breakthroughs and current events in :computer: tech. I love learning new things and I'm always open to working on interesting projects with new people! 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as VP of Development with [Void Tech](https://github.com/void-tech-um). As a student org, we work on applications that help Michigan students to improve and address problems within the student community on campus. 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about daily current events. I read the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/) and [TLDR](https://tldr.tech/) newsletter daily and enjoy discussing what's happening in the world. 

In my free time I enjoy running :runner:, biking :biking_woman:, hot yoga :lotus_position_woman:, playing the flute :musical_note:, and watching Michigan football :football:.

âš¡ Fun fact: I took a class on soldering electrical assemblies during my Northrop Grumman internship and became NASA Solder Certified.
