### Hi there, I'm Jennifer :raising_hand_woman: 
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/Hers

I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science with a minor in Complex Systems at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor (graduating April 2024) :part_alternation_mark: Go Blue! Last summer I interned at Northrop Grumman as a Systems Test Engineer and worked as a NASA contractor at the Armstrong Flight Research Center :rocket: . I'm a passionate student :books: with an intrinsic desire to learn more about new scientific breakthroughs and current events in :computer: tech. I love learning new things and I'm always open to working on interesting projects with new people! 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a developer lead on a mobile application with [Void Tech](https://github.com/void-tech-um). As a student org, we work on applications that help Michigan students to improve and address problems within the student community on campus. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about blockchain technology and decentralized applications. 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about daily current events. I read the Wall Street Journal and TLDR newletter daily and enjoy discussing what's happening in the world. 

In my free time I enjoy hot yoga :lotus_position_woman:, exploring the outdoors :mountain:, playing the flute :musical_note:, and watching Michigan football :football:.

âš¡ Fun fact: Last summer I took a class on soldering electrical assemblies and became NASA Solder Certified.
