### Hi there, I'm Jennifer! :raising_hand_woman: 
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/Hers

I'm a Kubernetes Site Reliability / Platform Engineer at Ford Motor Company working on [CaaS](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32444/containers-as-a-service-caas). I have a B.S. in Computer Science, minor in Complex Systems from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor :part_alternation_mark: Go Blue! Prior to my current role, I interned with Ford Motor Company :blue_car: as a Software Engineer Intern (Summer 2023) and at Northrop Grumman as a Systems Test Engineer where I worked as a NASA contractor at the Armstrong Flight Research Center :rocket: (Summer 2022). I'm a passionate learner :books: with an intrinsic desire to learn more about new scientific breakthroughs and current events in :computer: tech. I'm always open to working on interesting projects with new people! 

ðŸ”­ In the past, I was VP of Development at [VOID Tech](https://github.com/void-tech-um). As a student org, VOID works on applications that help Michigan students improve and address problems within the student community on campus. 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about daily current events. I enjoy discussing what's happening in the world. 

In my free time I enjoy running :runner:, biking :biking_woman:, golfing :golf:, hot yoga :lotus_position_woman:, reading about finance/economics :books:, playing the flute :musical_note:, and watching Michigan football :football:.

âš¡ Fun fact: I took a class on soldering electrical assemblies during my Northrop Grumman internship and became NASA Solder Certified.
